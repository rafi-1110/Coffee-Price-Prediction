# Coffee-Price-Prediction
Assessing the effectiveness of coffee price prediction by comparing statistical and machine learning models.

In this work, I have deployed a pair of statistical models, namely Exponential Smoothing
and SARIMA and compared their performance against a pair of Machine Learning
models, namely Random Forest and SVR. For Exponential Smoothing, the model implementation
and analysis were extended to two “sub-models”. The main objective of
the work was to compare these groups of models and determine if either group would
outperform the other in predicting coffee prices. To assess their performance, I used a
combination of methods: composite plots for price movement comparison analysis, error
metrics and code execution time.
